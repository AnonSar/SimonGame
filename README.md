# SimonGame
Created the memory technique based game called Simon in JavaScript. In this game the user has to memorize the sequence of the
colours displayed and then input that sequence. If the user's guess is correct, then the user starts getting longer sequence
but if the user's guess is wrong, then the game goes back to the previous level.
